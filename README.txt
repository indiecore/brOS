The title of the project remains Bros Recursive Operating System.

So far, we have the development environment set up and have a booting kernel as well as a global descriptor table. With the development environment finished we can continue development on the project. We believe that we are ~20% finished of the overall OS project.

For my portion of the project I have so far written most of the booting kernel as well as set up the development enviroment.

The last task in that particular section is to create the IDT (Inturrupt Descriptor Table) and map the intterupts of the keyboard to a function that will allow keyboard input.

After that my job will be linking the graphics funcions and other utlities written by the others in my group into the kernel as callable C functions.
