The title of the project remains Bros Recursive Operating System.

So far, we have the development environment set up and have a booting kernel as well as a global descriptor table. With the development environment finished we can continue development on the project. We believe that we are ~20% finished of the overall OS project.

For my portion of the project I have so far written most of the booting kernel as well as set up the development enviroment.

The graphics libs are implemented with help from Nick's math library and Peter provided some pretty cool options such as his custom wave thing (function hurr() ,press 3) and Conway's (function durr(), press 4)
